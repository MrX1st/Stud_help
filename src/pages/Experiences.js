      story: "When I struggled with my first programming assignment in Java, I felt completely lost. I went to the professor‚Äôs office hours, and instead of just giving me the solution, he patiently explained how the logic worked and encouraged me to think step by step. By the end of the semester, I actually passed the course with a good grade. That moment showed me that professors at UrFU really care if you are willing to put in the effort",

I went to the International Student Office, and one of the coordinators literally walked me through every form. They even called the migration service on my behalf. It took some time, but without their help, I could have been fined or even had to leave Russia. It made me feel secure that the university backs me up in critical moments",

It made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt just surviving abroad ‚Äî I was building a second family. To this day, my closest friends in Russia are the people I met in that dorm",

      story: "In one of my courses, the professor spoke only Russian and refused to explain anything in English. During the exam, I tried to answer in broken Russian, but he interrupted me and said he couldn‚Äôt understand. I felt humiliated in front of the class. After that, I talked to the program coordinator, who arranged for a tutor to help me. The situation improved, but I realized that sometimes you really need to push for help, otherwise your problems may be ignored",

I complained to the dorm administration, but they didn‚Äôt do much. It really tested my patience. On the positive side, I learned to be more independent and to solve conflicts myself, but I honestly think the dorm conditions could be improved",
